HANGMAN GAME

-----WHAT I DID-----
This project was assigned as we started learning vanilla javascript coding language. Conceptually, it was a relatively straightforward process of pseudocoding, but executing the concepts proved to be a challenge. I've since gone back and enhanced the game to be a bit more polished.

-----WHAT I LEARNED-----
The introduction to javascript was a big challenge as some of the concepts took a while for me to process. I was following the instructors in class, but then struggled when faced with a blank screen. Building functions was quite a challenge and I did a lot of Google searches and YouTube views to learn commands like .indexOf, .split, .join, .push and more. I also learned how to use custom fonts outside of a google font catalog. 


-----WHAT'S NEXT-----
One big flaw in the current site is that it doesn't play well with touch screens. I'm using an onKeyUp listener to capture the keystrokes. I want a touch of the start button to open a virtual keypad on phones and tablets. Since my first version, I have enhanced the visuals with a sticky footer, added images and phrases based the solutions and/or losses. If went back to refactor this game, I'd use objects instead of multiple arrays. Adding new words/images/phrases is a challenge in the current structure and if I were to add categories (names, castles, realms, etc.) it would be a structural challenge.
